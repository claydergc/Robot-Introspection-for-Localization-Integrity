Generally speaking, integrity risk is the probability that the position (or pose) estimation error is larger than the tolerable limit, while the navigation system, however, is not aware of the hazardous situation:

# In my own words

The integrity risk, as defined in the content from page 9 of [[@zhuIntegrityVisualNavigation2022]], refers to the probability that the position (or pose) estimation error is greater than the tolerable limit, while the navigation system is not aware of the hazardous situation. It is a measure of trust that can be placed in the navigation system outputs, reflecting the probability that the system's estimated error does not exceed the maximum allowable error defined by the alert limit (AL).
