# Original Text
Robustness can be defined as the ability of a system to tolerate perturbations, or the capability to endure uncertainty and noise, before system assumptions are irreversibly violated.

Significant research efforts have been dedicated to improving the accuracy of localisation algorithms for a specific domain, but in the authors' view, there is not enough emphasis on robustness. For example, there has been a significant focus on improving the localisation performance using the KITTI odometry datasct[1], where the best-performing algorithm in translational accuracy achieved an impressive 0.57%Â [2]. This is an improvement of 0.73% difference from the algorithm at 50th place, with only 0.0146% improvement per algorithm in the top 50 algorithms. These efforts has been concentrated on improving accuracy in a single domain without a consideration for generalisation to other domains.
