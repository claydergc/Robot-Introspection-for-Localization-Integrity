# Original Text
According to the definition from the European Space Agency (ESA), “Integrity is the measure of the trust that can be placed in the correctness of the information supplied by a navigation system. Integrity includes the ability of the system to provide timely warnings to users when the system should not be used for navigation,” (European Space Agency, 2011). In other words, an integrity risk is present whenever the system reports a position with sufficient confidence but the actual error exceeds an acceptable bound.
# In my own words
Integrity is a value that describes the correctness of the information supplied by a navigation system. An integrity system should have the ability to warn when the system should not be used.
