# Original Text
the navigation system needs to monitor the integrity of the parameters, usually by setting up some specific test statistics, and to conservatively calculate a protection level (PL) which guarantees that inside the bound of the PL, the occurrence probability of an undetected error does not exceed the maximum allowable integrity risk
# In my own words
The protection level is a calculated parameter in navigation systems that guarantees the maximum allowable error in the metric space. Is this a threshold?
