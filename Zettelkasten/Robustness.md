# Original Text
Robustness represents the capability of a system to recover from specific error and stay functional. The robustness concept has both similarities and differences with the integrity concept.

Robustness targets the availability and continuity aspects of the system (i.e., the system should be able to recover when faults occur and deliver [ideally correct] solutions continuously, even under difficult conditions). Sometimes, methods to improve robustness may increase the integrity risk. Meanwhile, integrity focuses on the correctness of the solution with quantified criteria. In safety-critical applications, it is crucial to recognize a situation in which the estimates are unreliable instead of providing a best-effort output at high risk.
