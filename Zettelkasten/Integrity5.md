# In my own words

GPS integrity is a term that date from 1980s reports of corporations related to civil aviation. Some of these reports are only mentioned in some literature like [[@blytheRELIABILITYNAVIGATIONSYSTEMS]], but it seems that they have not been digitized like [[@shivelycGPSIntegrityReliability1980]].

According to Parkinson et al. [[@parkinsonbradfordw.ReceiverAutonomousIntegrity1996]], integrity is the probability that the displayed position is within the specified or expected error boundaries.

As stated in [[@sangjizhangTHEORYDEVELOPMENTGPS1996]]:

Integrity of a radionavigation system is defined as (US DoD & US DoT, 1988): 

"The ability of a system to provide timely warning to users when the system should not be used for navigation."
