# Original Text
By comparing the PL value with the alert limit (AL) set according to application requirements, the system should issue an alert and should be marked unavailable if the PL is larger than the AL value.
# In my own words
The alert limit (AL) is defined as the maximum allowable error in the metric space within a visual navigation system. It is used to compare with the protection level (PL) calculated by the system according to application requirements. If the PL exceeds the AL value, the system triggers an alert within a required time to prevent hazardous situations.
