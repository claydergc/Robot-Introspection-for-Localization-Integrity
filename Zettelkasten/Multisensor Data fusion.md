Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) [9] defines data fusion as a ‘‘multilevel, multifaceted process handling the automatic detection, association, correlation, estimation, and combination of data and information from several sources.’’

Klein [10] generalizes this definition, stating that data can be provided either by a single source or by multiple sources.

‘‘Information fusion is the study of efficient methods for automatically or semi-automatically transforming information from different sources and different points in time into a representation that provides effective support for human or automated decision making’’

There are a number of mathematical theories available to represent data imperfection [31], such as probability theory [32], fuzzy set theory [33], possibility theory [34], rough set theory [35], and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DSET) [36]
