# Idea

The PLs obtained in aviation applications are too conservative for vehicular applications [9]. Airplanes travel in 14-kilometer-wide air corridors [27]. Simulations shows that while RAIM (Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring) availability is around 100% in open sky, it decreases dramatically in urban environments because of the occlusion of satellite signals by high-rise buildings, even with a 100-meter-wide alert limit [28]. RAIM availability is 55% in urban environments when using the GPS-Galileo dual constellation and with Pr fa = 5 × 10−3 and Prmd = 5 × 10−5. With the GPS constellation alone, this availability decreases to 7% [29].
