# Original Text

Reliability is not explicitly defined, but the concept is used in the context of range measurements for localization. The paper assumes that localization can be performed successfully if a small mean distance error is calculated for range measurements with relatively high reliability. The reliability of each range measurement is computed by considering the distance error computed based on known map information

It is focused on the reliability of range measurements.
