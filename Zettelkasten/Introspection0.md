# Original Text

Introspection. The act or process of self-examination; contemplation of one’s own thoughts and feelings; a looking inward [102]. A technique of self-observation [103].

Robotic introspection models and monitors operational state (i.e. a robot’s computational state) to assist robotic decision-making. In particular, this research develops an architectural framework for observing, mapping, localizing and planning in the space of operating modes.
