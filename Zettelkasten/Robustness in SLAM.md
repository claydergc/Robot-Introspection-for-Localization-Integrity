# Original Text
Cadena et al. (2016) provide a good review of the development status of SLAM techniques and the future trend in robustness improvement. Robustness represents the capability of a system to recover from specific error and stay functional. The robustness concept has both similarities and differences with the integrity concept.

The function of detecting and recovering from failures (i.e., fault detection and elimination) is of great importance for both robustness and integrity. From a methodological point of view, both robust approaches and integrity monitoring approaches apply tools like statistical testing and outlier rejection in order to detect faults and improve system performance. Robustness targets the availability and continuity aspects of the system (i.e., the system should be able to recover when faults occur and deliver [ideally correct] solutions continuously, even under difficult conditions). Sometimes, methods to improve robustness may increase the integrity risk. Meanwhile, integrity focuses on the correctness of the solution with quantified criteria. In safety-critical applications, it is crucial to recognize a situation in which the estimates are unreliable instead of providing a best-effort output at high risk.
# In my own words
Robustness represents the capability of a system to recover from specific error and stay functional. The robustness concept has both similarities and differences with the integrity concept. Is robustness related to Fault Detection and Elimination (FDE)? (Page 10)
