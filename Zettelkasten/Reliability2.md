# Original Text

In this paper, the reliability of the localization results is defined as the probability that the error in the estimated pose is included within an acceptable region (as in [1]). The acceptable region should be specified by considering the realistic application that uses the localization results. We explain the acceptable region and discuss the determination of this region in further detail in Section IV
