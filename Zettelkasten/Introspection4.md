# Original Text
This paper directly tackles introspection in the context of visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). It proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based approach, called Deep Introspective SLAM, which enables a robot to evaluate the safety of navigation steps with respect to tracking failure before taking those steps. The approach uses a novel deep Q-network to assess the safety of future navigation steps using a single image. This introspective capability helps the robot avoid navigation steps that could lead to tracking failures, thereby enhancing its autonomy and reliability in real-world environments.
