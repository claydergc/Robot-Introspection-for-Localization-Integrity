# Original Text
The performance of a perception algorithm can change drastically with small variations in the robot environment [73]. The ability to self-observe these environmental variations and identify the perceived failures is called introspection. More specifically, it is a methodology for error detection and uncertainty quantification. It is commonly applied to predict the performance of perception systems and take remedial actions to improve performance. The concept of introspection encapsulates all the layers and failure sources of the perception module: environment context, sensor, and algorithm. It predicts the error based on the end-to-end observations.

# In my own words

THIS PAPER REFERS TO THE THESIS BY MORRIS!!

Robots, in general, are expected to be functional in diverse and varying environmental conditions.
