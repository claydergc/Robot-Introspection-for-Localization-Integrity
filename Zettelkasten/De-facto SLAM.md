# Original Text
The current de-facto standard formulation of SLAM has its origins in the seminal paper of Lu and Milios [161], followed by the work of Gutmann and Konolige [102]. All these approaches formulate SLAM as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation problem, and often use the formalism of factor graphs [143] to reason about the interdependence among variables.

# In my own words
The de-facto SLAM are those SLAM algorithms based on the MAP estimation problem or factor graph optimization. This type of SLAM has two parts: back end and front end. This type of SLAM belongs to the algorithmic-analysis age (2004â€“2015). It uses libraries like iSAM.
