what is a hypothesis in statistics?

ChatGPT: 

In statistics, a hypothesis is a specific, testable statement or prediction about a population parameter. It is a claim or assumption that you want to test using statistical methods. There are generally two types of hypotheses involved in hypothesis testing:
 
1. **Null Hypothesis (H₀):**  This is the default assumption or statement that there is no effect or no difference. It serves as the baseline that you aim to test against. For example, it might state that there is no difference in mean scores between two groups.
 
2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha):**  This is the statement that you want to provide evidence for. It suggests that there is an effect or a difference. For example, it might state that there is a difference in mean scores between two groups.

The goal of hypothesis testing is to determine whether there is enough statistical evidence in your sample data to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. This is typically done using a test statistic and comparing it to a critical value or using a p-value to assess the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis.

You: 

could you give me a simple example?

ChatGPT: 

Sure! Let's consider a simple example involving a study on a new drug that aims to lower blood pressure.

### Scenario 

Suppose a pharmaceutical company claims that their new drug lowers blood pressure by an average of 10 mmHg. A researcher wants to test this claim.

### Step-by-Step Example 
 
1. **Formulate the Hypotheses:**  
  - **Null Hypothesis (H₀):**  The new drug does not lower blood pressure by 10 mmHg on average. Mathematically, this can be stated as $$H_0: \mu = 10$$, where $$\mu$$ is the mean reduction in blood pressure.
 
  - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):**  The new drug lowers blood pressure by an amount different from 10 mmHg. Mathematically, this can be stated as $$H_1: \mu \neq 10$$.
 
2. **Collect Data:** 
  - The researcher conducts a study and collects a sample of patients who take the drug. Let's say the sample size is 30 patients.
 
  - The researcher measures the reduction in blood pressure for each patient and calculates the sample mean ($$\bar{x}$$) and sample standard deviation (s).
 
3. **Perform the Test:** 
  - The researcher performs a statistical test, such as a t-test, to compare the sample mean to the hypothesized mean of 10 mmHg.
 
  - Calculate the t-statistic using the formula:
$$
 t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}} 
$$

where $$\bar{x}$$ is the sample mean, $$\mu$$ is the hypothesized mean (10 mmHg), $$s$$ is the sample standard deviation, and $$n$$ is the sample size (30).
 
4. **Determine the p-value:** 
  - The p-value indicates the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed value, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

  - If the p-value is less than the chosen significance level (commonly 0.05), the researcher rejects the null hypothesis.
 
5. **Make a Decision:** 
  - If the p-value is less than 0.05, the researcher rejects the null hypothesis and concludes that there is significant evidence to suggest the drug's effect on lowering blood pressure is different from 10 mmHg.

  - If the p-value is greater than 0.05, the researcher fails to reject the null hypothesis and concludes that there is not enough evidence to suggest the drug's effect is different from 10 mmHg.

### Example Data 

Let's assume the following sample data:
 
- Sample mean ($$\bar{x}$$) = 9.5 mmHg

- Sample standard deviation (s) = 2 mmHg

- Sample size (n) = 30

Using these values, calculate the t-statistic:
$$
 t = \frac{9.5 - 10}{2 / \sqrt{30}} \approx -1.37 
$$
Assuming a two-tailed test, look up the p-value for $$t = -1.37$$ with $$29$$ degrees of freedom in a t-distribution table or using a calculator/software.
### Conclusion 

Based on the p-value, decide whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. If the p-value is, for example, 0.18 (greater than 0.05), the researcher would fail to reject the null hypothesis, concluding that there is not enough evidence to suggest the drug lowers blood pressure by an amount different from 10 mmHg.

You: 

how can I calculate the p-value for your example?

ChatGPT: 

To calculate the p-value for the given example, you can use a t-distribution table or a statistical software/tool. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to calculate it manually and using software.

### Manual Calculation Using a t-Distribution Table 
 
1. **Calculate the t-statistic:** $$
 t = \frac{9.5 - 10}{2 / \sqrt{30}} \approx -1.37 
$$
 
2. **Determine the degrees of freedom (df):** $$
 \text{df} = n - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29 
$$
 
3. **Look up the t-statistic in the t-distribution table:**  
  - For $$t = -1.37$$ and $$\text{df} = 29$$, find the closest value in the t-distribution table. Tables typically provide cumulative probabilities for positive t-values, so you may need to use the symmetry of the t-distribution.
 
4. **Find the cumulative probability:**  
  - The table might give you the cumulative probability for $$t = 1.37$$ (since the distribution is symmetric, the value for $$t = -1.37$$ will be the same).
 
  - Suppose the cumulative probability for $$t = 1.37$$ is approximately 0.91.
 
5. **Calculate the p-value:**  
  - For a two-tailed test, the p-value is:
$$
 p = 2 \times (1 - 0.91) = 2 \times 0.09 = 0.18 
$$

### Using Statistical Software or a Calculator 

To make this process easier, you can use statistical software like R, Python, or even an online calculator. Here’s how you can do it in Python:
Using Python (with `scipy` library)

```python
from scipy import stats

# Given values
sample_mean = 9.5
hypothesized_mean = 10
sample_std_dev = 2
sample_size = 30

# Calculate the t-statistic
t_statistic = (sample_mean - hypothesized_mean) / (sample_std_dev / (sample_size ** 0.5))

# Calculate the degrees of freedom
df = sample_size - 1

# Calculate the p-value for a two-tailed test
p_value = 2 * stats.t.sf(abs(t_statistic), df)

t_statistic, p_value
```

#### Using R 


```R
# Given values
sample_mean <- 9.5
hypothesized_mean <- 10
sample_std_dev <- 2
sample_size <- 30

# Calculate the t-statistic
t_statistic <- (sample_mean - hypothesized_mean) / (sample_std_dev / sqrt(sample_size))

# Calculate the degrees of freedom
df <- sample_size - 1

# Calculate the p-value for a two-tailed test
p_value <- 2 * pt(abs(t_statistic), df, lower.tail = FALSE)

t_statistic
p_value
```

### Using an Online Calculator 

You can also use an online p-value calculator. Here’s how:
 
1. Go to an online t-distribution p-value calculator (e.g., [GraphPad]() ).

2. Enter the t-statistic (-1.37) and the degrees of freedom (29).

3. Choose a two-tailed test.

4. Calculate the p-value.

### Conclusion 

Using these methods, you’ll find the p-value. For our example with a t-statistic of -1.37 and 29 degrees of freedom, the p-value is approximately 0.18. This means that there is no significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the common significance level of 0.05.

You: 

why df=29?

ChatGPT: 

The degrees of freedom (df) for a t-test is determined by the sample size. Specifically, for a one-sample t-test, the degrees of freedom is calculated as:
$$
 \text{df} = n - 1 
$$
where $$n$$ is the sample size. The reasoning behind this is rooted in the concept of estimating population parameters from sample data.
Here's a detailed explanation:
 
1. **Sample Size (n):**  This is the number of observations in your sample. In your example, the sample size is 30.
 
2. **Degrees of Freedom (df):**  Degrees of freedom represent the number of independent pieces of information that are available to estimate another piece of information. When you calculate the sample mean, you use up one degree of freedom because the mean is an estimate of the population mean.$$
 \text{df} = n - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29 
$$

This means that, after using the sample data to calculate the sample mean, you have 29 pieces of independent information left to estimate the variability of the sample (i.e., the sample variance).

### Why Degrees of Freedom Matter 

Degrees of freedom are important because they affect the shape of the t-distribution, which in turn affects the calculation of the p-value. The t-distribution approaches the normal distribution as the degrees of freedom increase. With fewer degrees of freedom, the t-distribution is more spread out, which means the critical values are larger for smaller samples.

In summary, for a sample size of 30, the degrees of freedom for the one-sample t-test is 29 because we have 30 observations, but we lose one degree of freedom due to the estimation of the sample mean.
