# Idea

Applying traditional integrity measures to robots is difficult due to their highly variable environment and heavy reliance on cameras. Relatively few works define integrity for autonomous robotics in the literature, with some recent work including [13]â€“[16] and [17]. In general, integrity can be defined as the level of trust we are willing to place in a system. A localization integrity measure can be used to describe the extent to which we can trust that the real-time localization estimate produced by the system is within a pre-defined accuracy tolerance [18]. For the purposes of this work, we define an integrity measure as information that allows us to predict or detect whether a localization estimate along a route is within an acceptable tolerance from ground-truth, or not.
