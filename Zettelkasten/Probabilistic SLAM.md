# Original Text
The classical age saw the introduction of the main probabilistic formulations for SLAM, including approaches based on extended Kalman filters (EKF), Rao–Blackwellized particle filters, and maximum likelihood estimation; moreover, it delineated the basic challenges connected to efficiency and robust data association.

# In my own words
Probabilistic SLAM algorithms are based on Kalman filters (EKF), Rao–Blackwellized particle filters, and maximum likelihood estimation. These belongs to the classical age of the SLAM (1986–2004).
