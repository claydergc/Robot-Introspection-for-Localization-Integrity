# Original Text
Most robotics publications evaluate localization performance as a measure of the estimate variance, which is understood as not being sufficient when unmodeled faults occur. Faults are rarely occurring events not modeled by the usual Gaussian noise assumption. Examples include incorrect associations, misleading measurements due to moving objects, and previously unmapped static objects mistaken by parts of the map.
# In my own words
Faults are rare events that were not modeled by the usual Gaussian noise assumption.
